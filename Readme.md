# Local FileSystem explorer

In this project we have to create a system file explorer that allows the user to navigate, create, rename and delete directories and upload files.

## Installation

To execute our project, run a local server with Apache, Xampp, etc, and place the whole folder in your localhost. Open the directory in your browser, and automatically will execute index.php.


## Usage

The user can navigate through different directories in the side menu. When clicking on that folder, the content of that folder is shown on the screen (folders and / or files).
To find the folder or file you want you can also use the search bar where it will show you in the center of the screen what that folder contains. To view the details of the file you can click on it.
You can also create folders or files on the NEW button. Once created with a right click you can delete or rename the folder.
